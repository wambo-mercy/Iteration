Making a Cup of Coffee
The process of making coffee involves a series of steps that are repeated each time you make coffee.

Steps:
Boil water.
Add coffee grounds to a filter or French press.
Pour hot water over the grounds.
Wait for the coffee to brew.
Pour the coffee into a cup.
Add milk, sugar, or any other desired additions.
In this process, the act of boiling water and brewing coffee can be repeated multiple times, depending on how much coffee you want to make. The iterative nature is especially clear when you're preparing multiple cups of coffee in sequence.
