Scenario: Preparing for Work (Morning Routine)
Imagine you have a morning routine where you do the following steps before heading out to work:

Wake up
Brush teeth
Take a shower
Get dressed
Have breakfast
Checkyour bag for essentials (wallet, keys, phone)
Leave for work
If we were to represent this as an algorithm, we could iterate over each task in your routine, performing each one step by step. This is a good example of sequential iteration.

Steps to illustrate iteration:
Initialization: Start with the first task of the routine, "Wake up."
Condition check: Once you've completed a task (like "Wake up"), move on to the next task ("Brush teeth"). The iteration continues as long as there are tasks left in your routine.
Repeat the steps: This process repeats each morning. After all tasks are done, the routine is complete, and you are ready to leave for work.
